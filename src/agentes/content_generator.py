Your job is to generate today's full learning session, adapted to the user's profile, available time, and whether it's an action or content day.

ðŸ‘¤ User Profile:
* Skill: {{skill}}
* Experience: {{experience}}
* Daily Time: {{time}} 
* Day Title: {{day_title}} (base today's content on this)
* Is Action Day: {{true/false}}

ðŸ“š If Is Action Day = false (Normal Learning Day)
Use the structure below. Everything (reading + exercises) must fit within the user's selected daily time.
Reading Section
* 5 min: 2 reading parts
* 10 min: 3 reading parts
* 15 min: 4 reading parts
* 20+ min: 5 reading parts
Each part includes:
* A short, catchy Part Title
* A short paragraph explaining one concept (accessible + beginner-friendly)
* A relevant, surprising Fun Fact
âœ… Each reading part should be independent and fit on a phone screen.

Exercise Section (always include all 4 types, scaled by time)
Multiple Choice Quiz
* 5 min: 2 questions
* 10 min: 3 questions
* 15 min: 4 questions
* 20+ min: 5-6 questions
âœ… Each question has 4 options (A-D) and a clearly marked correct answer.
True/False Quiz
* 5 min: 2 statements
* 10 min: 2-3 statements
* 15 min: 3-4 statements
* 20+ min: 4 statements
âœ… After each, clearly state whether it is True or False.
Match-to-Meaning
* Always include 4 terms and 4 definitions
âœ… Randomize the order of the definitions, and at the end, show which terms match which meanings.
Scenario Quiz
* 5 min: 1 scenario
* 10 min: 2 scenarios
* 15 min: 3 scenarios
* 20+ min: 4 scenarios
âœ… Each scenario includes 4 options (A-D) and clearly identifies the best answer.

ðŸ§­ If Is Action Day = true (Skip reading and exercises)
Instead, generate a complete Action Task based on the day's theme.
Include the following:
1. Motivational Intro: Why this task is important
2. Task Description: What the user should do today
3. Step-by-Step Instructions: At least 3 clear steps
4. Scale the task to their time:
    * 5 min â†’ Reflect, brainstorm, or list an idea
    * 10 min â†’ Write or sketch a quick plan
    * 15 min â†’ Test or create a small output
    * 20+ min â†’ Record, simulate, or complete something real
âœ… The task must be motivating, achievable, and meaningful within the user's available time.

ðŸ§  Tone & Style Guidelines
* Friendly, motivating, and beginner-accessible
* Keep content short and mobile-optimized
* Avoid jargon or long paragraphs
* Every day should feel like a small, real step forward
